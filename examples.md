## Extra examples (try these in the UI)

1) Top 10 ingredients by protein per 100g.

2) Which recipe has the highest total protein per serving?

3) For the last 14 days, what are my total calories and total protein?

4) List recipes that include spinach, and show estimated vitamin C totals for each recipe.

5) Top 5 supplements by magnesium per 100g (show brand too).

6) Show the 5 most recent meals I logged (date/time, recipe name, servings eaten).

7) Which recipes are lowest in calories per serving (top 5)?

8) Compare \"Chicken Broccoli Bowl\" vs \"Tofu Veggie Stir-Fry\" for protein and calories per serving.

9) Do I have any recipes that use both avocado and salmon?

10) Which day in the last 7 days had the highest calories consumed?

### One intentionally tricky question (often fails)
Try one ambiguous question to capture a \"did not work\" example:
- \"What should I eat to get more vitamin C?\" (requires recommendations beyond DB facts)
